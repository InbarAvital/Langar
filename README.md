MY CURRENT WORK - NOT COMPLETE

My current goal is to create my own programming language, written in C.
I might add some cool unique things to it, still thinking :)

Let's see how it goes!

What I have so far regarding processing the code given to me:
   * Tokenizer - splits the code to tokens
   * Lexer - take the tokens code and add info
   * Organizer - organize the code to make it easier when we start compiling
   * Identifier - gives a role to each line
   * Shunting Yard algorithm - turns expressions to postfix notation

What I have so far regarding the compiler:
   * Functions
   * Variables -
        * deals with expressions such as: int a = 5+b*2-(4/2)
        * Currently only working with local variables inside a function. Later on I will add global Variables.
